## HTTP Request Types
There are a few types of HTTP methods that we need to know before building a REST API. These are the methods that correspond to the CRUD tasks:

POST: Used to submit data, typically used to create new entities or edit already existing entities
GET: Used to request data from the server, typically used to read data
PUT: Used to completely replace the resource with the submitted resource, typically used to update data
DELETE: Used to delete an entity from the server
Note: Notice that you can use either POST or PUT to edit stored data. You're free to choose whether you even want to use PUT since it can be omitted fully. Though, stay consistent with the HTTP verbs you use. If you're using POST to both create and update, then don't use the PUT method at all.
