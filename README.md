A WEB PAGE OF BEER YES BEER 
A JavaScript project to use the RestAPI And displey information about beers, using a search for the name of the beer and display name and id of the beers
using icons of the beer and for the web pages I use the HTML & CSS

## Introduction
 Build a REST API to manage beers with Node.js and Express. installed node.js, that is an experience in JavaScript, and some basic knowledge of HTML and Bootstrap.
 I will use a simple JavaScript array to store our data instead.

## HTTP Request Types
There are a few types of HTTP methods that I know before build a REST API. These are the methods that correspond to the CRUD tasks:

POST: Used to submit data, typically used to create new entities or edit already existing entities
GET: Used to request data from the server, typically used to read data
PUT: Used to completely replace the resource with the submitted resource, typically used to update data
DELETE: Used to delete an entity from the server

Note: Notice that you can use either POST or PUT to edit stored data. choose whether you even want to use PUT since it can be omitted fully. Though, stay consistent with the HTTP verbs you use. I am  using POST for an update, "I don't use the PUT method at all".
